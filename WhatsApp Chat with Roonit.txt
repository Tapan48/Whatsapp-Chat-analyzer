17/08/2020, 14:09 - Roonit: bro hows the derivative of 1/x^4 is x^-3...it should be ^-5....
17/08/2020, 14:14 - Roonit: 😅
17/08/2020, 14:18 - ..: You deleted this message
17/08/2020, 14:27 - ..: You know  let ur subconcious mind think ,,do some other work ,,,,let ur and mine brain think
17/08/2020, 14:28 - ..: Is the question right
17/08/2020, 14:28 - Roonit: yup ...
17/08/2020, 14:28 - Roonit: it has an answer...but i didnt see it
17/08/2020, 14:29 - Roonit: so is urs i suppose... cant make an u sub
17/08/2020, 14:29 - ..: U mean substitution
17/08/2020, 14:30 - Roonit: ha...😅 bprp says so...addat
17/08/2020, 14:31 - ..: Yes u can ,but don't do that its time consuming
17/08/2020, 14:31 - ..: Take x^ 4 common
17/08/2020, 14:31 - Roonit: ur ques is right...see when x4 comes out it becomes x5 thus can be substituted
17/08/2020, 14:31 - ..: Ha
17/08/2020, 14:32 - Roonit: here its √
17/08/2020, 14:32 - ..: Now in ur question???

17/08/2020, 14:35 - ..: wait
17/08/2020, 14:37 - ..: In my solution just make that x^5 by multiplying x^2 up and down
17/08/2020, 14:38 - ..: And substitute x ^ 2 as
17/08/2020, 14:38 - Roonit: √t

14/09/2020, 20:04 - ..: Do we have information about that particle whether it is a sphere or not
14/09/2020, 20:04 - Roonit: no its just particle
14/09/2020, 20:07 - ..: Mg downwards ,,upthrust upwards,,and resistive force upwards
14/09/2020, 20:07 - ..: But no options like that
14/09/2020, 20:07 - Roonit: B
14/09/2020, 20:08 - ..: But initially
14/09/2020, 20:08 - ..: How u explain that
14/09/2020, 20:08 - Roonit: initially the velocity must increase....as it's accelerating downwards
14/09/2020, 20:08 - Roonit: due to gravity
14/09/2020, 20:10 - ..: Integration lage ga shayad ?
14/09/2020, 20:11 - Roonit: but in question they say that the repulsive force is proportional to square of its speed.... thus the graph must look y2 graph in first.... so option A...
14/09/2020, 20:11 - Roonit: but they say here option C....
14/09/2020, 20:12 - Roonit: coz i think that the velocity must decrease later on... coz buoyancy
it would start decelerating

07/05/2021, 16:47 - Roonit: The presence of over 200 Chinese marine ships in the South China sea is a reminder of China's intention to claim large areas of international prominence as its sovereign territory✅ As Philippines reminded China of the ruling that denied the legality of Chinese claims, China dismissed the ruling📌 IMUN 57.0 is gravely concerned about the escalating tensions in South China Sea and aims to come to a resolution through its DISEC Committee🚩
.
In addition, it focusses on topical issues of xenophobia, racism and employment of refugees🔥 IMUN 57.0 is also focussed on moving ahead with the attaining of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) of clean water, eLearning, mental health and two Committees on gender equality🤩 One of these gender equality Committees will be in Bahasa Indonesian🇲🇨 so if you speak the language, we highly recommend you take part in this Committee 📌
.
This new Committee is part of IMUN's tireless efforts to include more diverse voices in its platform📢 The world cannot progress unless everyone's voice matters and IMUN seeks to consciously hold space for more voices😀
.
Join us in this breakthrough session where we unfold the complexities of the South China Sea, racism and more. It's going to be a good one and seats are limited, so make sure you register now at www.internationalmun.org
