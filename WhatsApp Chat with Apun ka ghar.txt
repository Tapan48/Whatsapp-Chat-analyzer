11/06/2020, 17:23 - Dad: The rain was pouring down heavily in Colaba And standing in front of a big puddle outside a pub, was  old Parsi Uncle, drenched, holding a stick, with a piece of string dangling in the water.

A passer-by stopped and asked, "What are you doing, uncle?"

"Fishing" replied the old man.

Feeling sorry for the old man, the gentleman said, "Come  out of the rain and have a drink with me, uncle."

In the warmth of the pub, as they sip their whiskies, the gentleman cannot resist asking, "So how many have you caught today?"

"You're the fourth" says the clever old Parsi .😂

18/08/2020, 01:48 - Anna: No mom, I have it with me
18/08/2020, 15:15 - Anna: Sir,

I have been on leave since 29-7-2020 as father is not keeping well since May 2020. He was admitted thrice since May 2020. First from 19-5-2020 to 21-5-2020, then from 29-7-2020 to 31-7-2020, then again from 7-8-2020 to 10-8-2020. 

During each hospital admission, gradually it was getting very difficult to  get  a hospital, relatively free of COVID atmosphere. Doctor in each hospital used to turn us away.

Father, aged 78 due to his present medical condition, needs constant  medical help/assistance. Under the above stated circumstances
18/08/2020, 21:09 - Dad: Hi Shan...Taps....how r u both.
18/08/2020, 21:48 - Mom: Good👍

29/10/2021, 08:54 - Dad: *बुढापा पैरों से शुरु होता है*
(विशेषतः मेरे सीनियर सिटीजन मित्रों के लिए)

मुझे आज उपरोक्त संदर्भ में एक समझने लायक लेख मिला। मैं तो रोज कम से कम 45 मिनट लगातार पैदल चलता हूं जो मेरे ब्लड शुगर लेवल को नियंत्रित रखने में मदद करता है व यही सीनियर सिटीजन्स हेतु सबसे अच्छी एक्सरसाइज है। इस लेख में पैदल चलने के और भी फायदे बताए हैं। मैं पैरों के नर्व्स और वेंस के लिए स्ट्रेच एक्सरसाइज़ में अलाली कर लेता था, जो अब से नही करूँगा। क्योंकि पिंडली को कुछ लोग उसमें पाए जाने वाले नर्व्स और वेंस के कारण उसे छोटा दिल जो कहते हैं। शायद ये लेख आपको भी अच्छा लगे।

*बुढ़ापा पैरों से शुरू होकर ऊपर की ओर बढ़ता है !  अपने पैरों को सक्रिय और मजबूत रखें !!*

जैसे-जैसे हम ढलते जाते हैं और रोजाना बूढ़े होते जाते हैं, हमें पैरों को हमेशा सक्रिय और मजबूत बनाए रखना चाहिए।

 हम लगातार बूढ़े हो रहे हैं, वृद्ध हो रहे हैं, मगर हमें  बालों के भूरे होने, त्वचा के झड़ने (या) झुर्रियों से डरना नहीं चाहिए।

दीर्घायु के संकेतों में, जैसा कि अमेरिकी पत्रिका प्रिवेंशन (रोकथाम) में मजबूत पैर की मांसपेशियों को शीर्ष पर सूचीबद्ध किया गया है, क्योंकि यह सबसे महत्वपूर्ण और आवश्यक है।

यदि आप दो सप्ताह तक अपने पैर नहीं हिलाते हैं, तो आपके पैरों की ताकत 10 साल कम हो जाएगी। यानी आप दस साल बूढ़े हो जाएंगे।

डेनमार्क में कोपेनहेगन विश्वविद्यालय के एक अध्ययन में पाया गया कि वृद्ध और युवा दोनों, *निष्क्रियता* के दो हफ्तों के दौरान, पैरों की मांसपेशियों की ताकत *एक तिहाई  कम हो सकती है जो 20 से 30 साल की उम्र के बराबर है।*

जैसे-जैसे हमारे पैर की मांसपेशियां कमजोर होती जाती हैं, ठीक होने में लंबा समय लगता है, भले ही हम बाद में पुनर्वास और व्यायाम करें।

इसलिए, *चलने जैसे नियमित व्यायाम बहुत जरूरी हैं*।

पूरे शरीर का भार पैरों पर रहता है और शरीर आराम करता है। पैर एक प्रकार के स्तंभ हैं, जो मानव शरीर के पूरे भार का वहन करते हैं।

दिलचस्प बात यह है कि किसी व्यक्ति की 50% हड्डियाँ और 50% मांसपेशियाँ दोनों पैरों में ही होती हैं। मानव शरीर के सबसे बड़े और मजबूत जोड़ और हड्डियां भी पैरों में होती हैं।

 ▪️मजबूत हड्डियां, मजबूत मांसपेशियां और लचीले जोड़ "आयरन ट्राएंगल" का निर्माण करते हैं जो सबसे महत्वपूर्ण भार यानी *मानव शरीर को वहन करता है।*

 ️७०% मानव गतिविधियां और कैलोरी बर्निंग इन्हीं दो पैरों से होते हैं। 

क्या आप यह जानते हैं?  जब इंसान जवान होता है तो उसकी *जांघों में इतनी ताकत होती है कि वह 800 किलो की छोटी कार को उठा सके।*

 ️ *पैर शरीर की हरकत का केंद्र है*।

दोनों पैरों में मिलकर मानव शरीर की ५०% नसें, ५०% रक्त वाहिकाएं और ५०% रक्त उनमें से बहता है।

 ▪️ यह सबसे बड़ा संचार नेटवर्क है जो शरीर को जोड़ता है।

केवल जब पैर स्वस्थ होते हैं तब रक्त की कन्वेंशन धारा सुचारू रूप से प्रवाहित होती है, इसलिए जिन लोगों के पैर की मांसपेशियां मजबूत होती हैं, उनका हृदय निश्चित रूप से मजबूत होता है।

*बुढ़ापा पैरों से ऊपर की ओर जाता है।*

जैसे-जैसे व्यक्ति बूढ़ा होता है, मस्तिष्क और पैरों के बीच निर्देशों के संचरण की सटीकता और गति कम होती जाती है, इसके विपरीत जब कोई व्यक्ति युवा होता है तो यह बहुत तेज और सटीक होती है।

 ️इसके अलावा, तथाकथित अस्थि उर्वरक (कैल्शियम) समय बीतने के साथ खो जाएगा, जिससे बुजुर्गों को हड्डियों के फ्रैक्चर का खतरा अधिक हो जाएगा।

बुजुर्गों में अस्थि भंग आसानी से जटिलताओं की एक श्रृंखला को ट्रिगर कर सकता है, विशेष रूप से घातक रोग जैसे मस्तिष्क घनास्त्रता।

क्या आप जानते हैं कि आम तौर पर 15 फीसदी बुजुर्ग मरीजों की जांघ की हड्डी में फ्रैक्चर के एक साल के भीतर मौत हो जाती है ?

 ️* *पैरों की एक्सरसाइज करने में कभी देर नहीं करनी चाहिए, 60 साल की उम्र के बाद भी यदि आप नियमित व्यायाम करें तो परिणाम चौंकाने वाले होते हैं।*

 ️हालांकि समय के साथ हमारे पैर धीरे-धीरे बूढ़े हो जाएंगे, लेकिन हमें पैरों का व्यायाम करना जीवन भर का काम बना लेना चाहिए।

केवल पैरों को मजबूत करके ही आगे बढ़ती उम्र को रोका या कम किया जा सकता है।

 ▪️कृपया रोजाना कम से कम 30-40 मिनट टहलें ताकि यह सुनिश्चित हो सके कि आपके पैरों को पर्याप्त व्यायाम मिले और यह सुनिश्चित हो सके कि आपके पैरों की मांसपेशियां स्वस्थ रहें।

यदि आप सहमत हैं तो आपको इस महत्वपूर्ण जानकारी को अपने सभी दोस्तों और परिवार के सदस्यों के साथ साझा करना चाहिए, क्योंकि हर व्यक्ति रोज बूढ़ा हो रहा है।

मस्त रहें, स्वस्थ रहें, प्रसन्न रहें और नियमित 5 km पैदल अवश्य चलें.

  👍🏽🏃🏽‍♀️🚶🏽‍♀️ *_Keep Walking!_* 🏃🏽‍♀️🚶🏽👍🏽

*_The calf muscle in your legs is your second heart._*

Everyone knows that the heart pumps blood, right? But did you know that your body has a second blood pump? It’s your calf muscles! That’s right, the calf muscles in your legs are your second heart! 

The human body is engineered such that when you walk, the calf muscles pump venous blood back toward your heart.

The veins in your calf act like a reservoir for blood your body does not need in circulation at any given time. These reservoir veins are called _muscle venous sinuses._ When the calf muscle contracts, blood is squeezed out of the veins and pushed up along the venous system. These veins have one-way valves which keep the blood flowing in the correct direction toward the heart, and also prevent gravity from pulling blood back down your legs.

Walking or running enables your foot to  play a major role in the pumping mechanism of the calves. The foot itself also has its own (smaller) venous reservoir. During the first motion of taking a step, as you put weight on your foot, the foot venous reservoir blood is squeezed out and ‘primes’ the calf reservoir. Then, in the later stages of a step, the calf muscle contracts and pumps the blood up the leg, against gravity. The valves keep the blood flowing in the right direction and prevents gravity from pulling the blood right back down.

Thus, when you are immobile for long periods of time (sitting in an airplane, car seat, or chair for hours) your calf muscle is not contracting much and the blood stagnates.

That’s why walking or running is so good for overall blood circulation. It prevents blood pooling and helps prevent potentially dangerous blood clots called _deep vein thrombosis_(DVT).

Another condition called _venous insufficiency, or venous reflux_ can cause blood to pool in your legs due to the failure of the valves to work properly. In this condition, the valves fail to prevent the backflow of blood down your legs. Symptoms of _venous insufficiency_ can include heavy, tired, throbbing, painful legs, ankle swelling, bulging varicose veins, cramps, itching, restless leg, skin discolouration and even skin ulceration. _Venous insufficiency_ is a very common disorder, affecting over 40 million people in the U.S.

In cases when a person is even more immobile, such as laying in a hospital bed, the pooled blood can become stagnant and develop into a blood clot. This is called a _deep vein thrombosis_ (DVT). DVT can cause leg pain and swelling and is dangerous because a blood clot can break off and travel in your blood stream and get lodged in your lungs.🦵🏼🦵🏼

06/03/2022, 22:49 - 🥷: First, convert R as a percent to r as a decimal
r = R/100
r = 7/100
r = 0.07 rate per year,

Then solve the equation for A
A = P(1 + r/n)nt
A = 7,000,000.00(1 + 0.07/1)(1)(6.5)
A = 7,000,000.00(1 + 0.07)(6.5)
A = $10,866,572.83
06/03/2022, 23:02 - 🥷: First, convert R as a percent to r as a decimal
r = R/100
r = 6/100
r = 0.06 rate per year,

Then solve the equation for A
A = P(1 + r/n)nt
A = 7,000,000.00(1 + 0.06/1)(1)(6.5)
A = 7,000,000.00(1 + 0.06)(6.5)
A = $10,223,183.69

Summary:
The total amount accrued, principal plus interest, with compound interest on a principal of $7,000,000.00 at a rate of 6% per year compounded 1 times per year over 6.5 years is $10,223,183.69.
